There is no actual opensource script right now. You have to pay for it if you want it. Yi12345 proyect is inactive, so Im fixing this version and making all changes open for everybody.
If you find a bug fill free to report it. I will try to solution to it as soon as possible.

Note: This is not an exact copy of T4. Some changes have been made to the interface and gameplay in order to provide a better estability and player experience.

Thank you,
